# Prompt Template Case Study — Variable-Based Prompt Design

## Goal
Show how variables (`{{variable}}`) allow prompts to be reused across multiple contexts, enabling scalable, automated, and professional prompt engineering workflows.

## 1. Base Template (With Variables)

    [SYSTEM]: You are a professional definition bot.

    [USER]:
    Task: Provide a definition.
    Topic: {{topic}}
    Format: 3 bullet points.
    Tone: simple and clear.

### Why This Is Useful
- The same prompt works for any topic  
- Only the variable changes (`{{topic}}`)  
- Clean structure → easy to automate  
- Industry-standard approach for agents, pipelines, and API workflows

## 2. Filling the Variable

### Variable Values

    topic = "quantum computing"

### Resulting Prompt (After Substitution)

    [SYSTEM]: You are a professional definition bot.

    [USER]:
    Task: Provide a definition.
    Topic: quantum computing
    Format: 3 bullet points.
    Tone: simple and clear.

## 3. Generated Output

    • A computing paradigm that uses quantum bits (qubits) to perform operations.
    • Exploits quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to solve complex problems more efficiently.
    • Applied in optimization, cryptography, and simulation of advanced physical systems.

## 4. Key Learnings
- Variables create reusable, scalable prompt templates  
- Professional prompts separate *structure* from *content*  
- The same template can run with hundreds of different topics  
- Ideal for automated systems, agents, and API-driven workflows

## 5. Conclusion
> Variable-based prompts improve flexibility, maintainability, and scalability in prompt engineering.  
They enable automation and allow a single template to generate consistently structured outputs across different topics.
